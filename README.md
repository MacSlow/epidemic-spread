# 2D simulation of spreading of virus 

## About
During March of 2020 the corona-pandemic ([Covid-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019)) hits the world on a global scale. Since
there is no vaccine available yet, the only option to slow the infection-rate, is
to practise social distancing. That is needed to avoid overloading a country's 
health-care infrastructure.
To better illustrate how and why this works, this interactive JavaScript program
can be used.

## Live demo
In order to give it a try and play around with the simulation values, you can use
the [live version](https://macslow.org/epidemic-spread).

## Known bugs
- resize messes up simulation-state
- simulation is frame-based

## Ideas/Todo
- heat-map for initial population distribution
- country-border map
- port to WebAssembly
- improve visuals
- improve graph-plots
- make simulation time-based
- expose more simulation parameters
